# Climate Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze climatic patterns based on geographical coordinates and seasonal fluctuations. The analysis includes exploring spatial variations in key climatic parameters (such as temperature and precipitation) and understanding the seasonal impact on various environmental factors.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with the complete analysis.
- `images/`: Folder for storing images generated from the analysis.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the notebook.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

To install the required packages, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Data

The data used in this project is stored in the `data/` directory. The primary dataset is `climate_data.csv`, which includes various climatic parameters like temperature, precipitation, humidity, etc.

## Analysis

The analysis is performed in the Jupyter notebook located in the `notebooks/` directory. The notebook includes:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
2. **Spatial Analysis of Climatic Parameters**
3. **Seasonal Analysis of Climatic Parameters**

## Running the Notebook

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone:https://github.com/Saravana999/Shadow-Fox/new/main

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd climate_analysis

3. Install the required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the Jupyter notebook
